A project to develop and demonstrate skills in CSS, Git, and browser Developer Tools  by duplicating a popular website (google.com). 

## Demonstrated Skills
This project is a result of my study of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). In this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Writing my own readme file
- Version control in Git, using the linux command line.
- Refine skills in CSS, with an emphasis on layout and best practices.
- Use the Developer Tool in Chrome to troubleshoot design elements.
- Familiarity with HTML5.
- Modest responsive web design.

## Getting Started
Website should be viewable in any modern browser. After you have cloned from Github via your favored method, open index.html in your favorite browser to view the page.
